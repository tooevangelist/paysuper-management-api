## API Reference

PaySuper Management API consists of public API methods which paths start with the `/api/v1/` and are documented in the [API Reference](https://docs.pay.super.com/api).

This project also contains internal API methods which paths start with `/system/` and `/admin/`.

## Developing

### Branches

We use the [GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model) as a branching model for Git.

### Built With

??? List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)

### Prerequisites

??? What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.

### Setting up Dev

??? Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

??? If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying

??? Give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

PaySuper Management API uses the endpoint versioning. The current version is `/v1`.

## Configuration

??? Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

## Tests

Every API method is covered by tests. The tests classes located in the same directory `internal/handlers` with code classes and have suffix `_test` at the end of its titles.

Test resources located in the `test` directory.
