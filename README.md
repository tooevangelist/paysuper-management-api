PaySuper is a unique, simple payment toolkit designed to make developers self-reliant. It’s an open-source payment service 
with a highly customizable payment form, an intuitive API, and comprehensible, eye-catching reports.

Management API is the [dashboard](https://github.com/paysuper/paysuper-management-server) and [payment form](https://github.com/paysuper/paysuper-payment-form)
REST API backend. Do not handle any payment processing business logic - just proxy all requests to [billing server](https://github.com/paysuper/paysuper-billing-server)
micro-service.
